#### Getting Started    
This program is structured in 2  steps.  First step, the user selects  the filters that are going to be  applied to the database. The user is  able to chose as many filters as it  would like. After this step, the DataFrame for  the analysis is created based on the  filters chosen by the user.  In a second moment, the user is  able to chose, from a list of options,  the statistics the user would like to  calculate, based on the available  filtered data
###Software

You'll need Python 3 to run the statistics.
